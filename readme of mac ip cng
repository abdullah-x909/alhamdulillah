## 🛡️ Why Use This Tool?

Keeping your identity protected on public networks or during sensitive activities is crucial. This script combines MAC address spoofing and Tor-based IP changing for maximum privacy — all in one simple tool.

---

## ⚡ Quick Start

```bash
git clone https://github.com/abdullah-x909/mac_ip_tor_changer.git
cd mac_ip_tor_changer
chmod +x mac_ip_tor_changer.sh
sudo ./mac_ip_tor_changer.sh
```

- The script will:
  - Install all required packages (`macchanger`, `tor`) if missing
  - Detect your main network interface
  - Ask how often to rotate your MAC & IP (you set the delay!)
  - Ask if you want a specific MAC or randomization
  - Start changing your MAC & IP automatically
  - Add itself to system startup so you’re always protected!

---

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Linux (Debian/Ubuntu, Fedora, Arch, etc.)
- sudo privileges

---

## 📝 Script Overview

- **Privacy First:** Each cycle, your MAC address is changed (random or custom), and Tor is restarted for a new IP.
- **User-Friendly:** No manual setup — just run and relax!
- **Auto-Startup:** Adds itself to your crontab (@reboot), so you’re always anonymous after a reboot.

---

## 🛠️ Advanced

- To remove from startup: `crontab -e` and delete the relevant line.
- To check Tor status: `sudo systemctl status tor`
- To check your new IP: Visit [https://check.torproject.org/](https://check.torproject.org/) after the script runs.
